  This Guided Assistant asks you questions and uses your answers to build a Personal Action Plan - a list of steps to help you ask for child support in Alaska.
  
  This interview can help you find information to:
  
	* Ask the court for child support when you start a case.
	* Ask the court for child support during a case.
	* Ask the state administrative agency, Child Support Services Division, for child support.
	* Prove or disprove your child’s biological father, and
	* Fill out the court’s child support forms.

  The judge will enter a final child support order at the end of your case, and pick the date child support should start.  
  
  Child support is usually owed when parents do not live together.  
  
  Sometimes, when a case ends, one parent owes the other parent back child support.  
  
  If you do not want to wait until the end of your case, you can ask the judge for an “interim” Child Support order.    
fields:
  - "What do you want to do?": interim_motion
    input type: radio
    choices:
      - "Wait for the judge to order child support at the end of my case.": wait
      - "Ask the judge to order child support while my case is going on": ask 
  - note: |
      #### <i class="fa-regular fa-lightbulb"></i> Learn more ####
      An interim order is any order the judge makes before they make the final order or decree. 
      The judge can make short-term decisions about child support, the parenting plan, 
      % if (existing_case == 'open' and user_role_in_case == 'defendant' and need_to_respond) or (existing_case == 'unknown' and after_courtview == 'open' and user_role_in_case == 'defendant' and need_to_respond): 
        % if case_type in('divorce', 'dissolution', 'legal separation'):
       possession of the family home, spousal support or payment of debts, 
        % endif
      % elif existing_case == 'none' or (existing_case == 'unknown' and after_courtview == 'none'):
        % if parents_married:
       possession of the family home, spousal support or payment of debts, 
        % endif
      % endif
      and attorney fees. The final order may be entirely different.

  How many children will your child support order cover?

      - "More than 1 child": more than one
  - note: |
      #### <i class="fa-regular fa-lightbulb"></i> Learn more ####
      
      Child support is to support  children  who are under 18.

      Child support orders usually last until your child turns 19 if:
      
      1. They still live with you or their other parent, and
      2. They are finishing high school.
---
id: Paternity
question: |
  Paternity
subquestion: |
 Parents are responsible for financially supporting their children.  
  
  A child's biological father is generally their legal father.

  If parents disagree, either parent can ask the court to decide.  
 
  * Proving someone is the **biological** father of a child is called "establishing paternity."
  * Proving someone is not the **biological** father is called "disestablishing paternity." 

  Do you want to add information about establishing or disestablishing paternity to your Personal Action Plan?
fields:
  - no label: paternity
    datatype: yesnoradio
  - note: |
      #### <i class="fa-regular fa-lightbulb"></i> Learn more ####
      Is the law different if my child:
      
      *	is adopted, 
      *	has parents who are the same gender,
      *	has transgender parents, or
      * was conceived by in vitro fertilization, or surrogacy?
      
      A person who adopts a child is the child's legal parent.
      Usually, you cannot “undo” an adoption to “disestablish paternity”.
      
      These situations can be complicated.  If you have questions, it is a good idea to talk to a lawyer.

id: Ask CSSD or the Court for a child support order
question: |
  Do you want to ask the court or CSSD to order a child support?
subquestion: |
  % if paternity:
  Your action plan includes information about "establishing paternity" and "disestablishing paternity."
  % endif
  
  A child support order tells one parent to pay child support to the other parent.
  
  **The Alaska Court** orders child support as part of a Parenting Plan in divorce, custody, dissolution or legal separation cases.  Parenting Plans are sometimes called “custody orders”.  
  A Parenting Plan is a list of decisions about:
  
  *	which parent pays child support, 
  *	the amount of child support
  *	a schedule for when and how long your children will stay at each parent’s house, 
  *	a holiday schedule,
  *	how you will make decisions about your children, and 
  *	financial questions like: 
    *	“How to spend our children’s PFDs?” or 
    *	“Which parent should claim any child tax credits?”  
  
  **The Alaska Child Support Services Division (CSSD)** can order child support but does not order Parenting Plans. CSSD child support orders work best if you do not need a Parenting Plan.

  - "I want to learn how to ask for child support from:": ask_court_or_cssd

  - note: |
      #### <i class="fa-regular fa-lightbulb"></i> How does the court or CSSD decide how much Child Support to order?####
      The Alaska Supreme Court sets the guidelines that judges and Alaska Child Support Services must follow when they decide the amount of child support payments. You can read the rule and the Child Support Guideline Committee’s comments about the rule online See [Child Support Awards in Civil Rule 90.3](https://casetext.com/rule/alaska-court-rules/alaska-rules-of-civil-procedure/part-xii-special-proceedings/rule-903-child-support-awards) or [the court's PDF](https://public.courts.alaska.gov/web/rules/docs/civ.pdf)
